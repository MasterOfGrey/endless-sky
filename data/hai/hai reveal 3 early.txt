			`	"You see," says Sayari, "in the light of the recent civil war your species has had, some of the Elder's are less than keen with allowing a partisan observer to see the inner workings of a station in its earliest phases, especially when we haven't built one in so, so long."`
			`	Now that she mentions it, you don't think you've seen a Hai station at all.`
			`	"However, therein lies a problem," says Xilin.`
			`	"The Republic will not allow the Hai to build a station this side of the wormhole without some oversight by someone we trust. This has now been a point of contention for some days, and multiple suggestions have been rejected."`

I have convinced the other diplomats and the Elders that you might be a viable solution to this impasse. The human diplomats have already agreed, but the Elders wish to speak with you first."`

You have been asked to fulfill the role of supervisor as a result. The Elders asked you some odd questions, but agreed that you were an acceptable individual for the task.`

You're not really sure what most of it has to do with anything, but eventually one of the elders stands up.`
