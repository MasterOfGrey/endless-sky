Every single building in the city is made from the same metal alloy, a dull and slightly irregular grey color. The corners of each building are slightly beveled instead of meeting at right angles.`

			`	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`
			`	Alondo looks surprised, but Mr Yang and Ms Adrianopolous both merely nod sagely.`
			`	"Extra security forces are being called in, but we've been busier in Wah Ki than usual lately."`
			`	Mr Yang pulls out a datapad, "Well then I'm afraid I may have some bad news. May I?"`
			`	He gestures to a display and then takes control when indicated.`
			`	"One of the things I brought with me was Republic Intelligence's estimate of the effectiveness of various information containment measures."`
			`	A series of charts are thrown up on the screen. You're not an expert at reading this sort of data but highlighted percentages ranging from as low as 4% to only as high as 39% do not look promising. The final graphic is a map of stages of what is labelled as 'artifact penetration'.`
			`	"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is other than the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr Yang.`
			`	He checks the date, "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months or lose so much credibility as to compromise elctoral stability, the actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`"Would that be so bad?"`
			`"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret, if we act sooner we may control the manner of that secret's release."`
			`Sayari looks at you, "We will have to come up with a plan, and quickly, but for the moment may I ask a favour of the war hero in the room? Please meet up with the security forces converging on Allhome, help them route the pirates back to the other side of the wormhole it will buy us some breathing space and some options."`
			`It is so hard to say "no" to a Hai and their cute squirrelly features.`
			choice
				`"I'll do what I can."`

			`When you land on Deep Katya is there waiting for you along with Alondo, "<First> it's so good to see you again! When the Republic briefed the council we were very concerned by the lack of ability to reach you, but of course you would somehow manage to be in the thick of it before we even knew what was going on."`
			`	You hug them both in turn and return the greeting as you look from one to the other, "I thought it seemed odd when they said I was meeting you for this Katya, but it makes much more sense if you were just easier to get a hold of than ALondo here."`
			`	"Oh it was always going to be Alondo," she says, "but there's never a bad excuse for travelling with an old friend, especially when you're meeting other friends too."`

His ship, called the Black Lich, is hanging out in Waypoint with the stolen Geocoris that we hear might have been converted into some kind of semi-stable weapons platform and now be being used as a temporary base."`

	description "This modified Geocoris has identical cargo capacity but is modelled off one that was the result of an alien technology being merged with a hybrid Human-Hai operating system. It has additional shield emitters in a geodesic pattern over its main cargo wings and a crucial element of the ship's system core is not manufactured, but grown from inital samples taken from the first occurrence. This means that some systems are built-in and unable to be removed, and also that it is sustantially more expensive than its regular version. It is; however, significantly more survivable."
