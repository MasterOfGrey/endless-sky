			`Terrified, you see you're in a room filled with angry squirrels. Suddenly one's arm is ripped off and blood spatters on a nearby wall. There's a map on the wall, but you can't quite see it. You struggle to see, but you're dream is cut short as you awaken.`
			`	You've had this dream every night for a week now. At long last, you realize it isn't a dream; it is a memory. When Teeneep cut the arm off an Unfettered warrior, blood spattered on a map on the wall. A map of a region north of Hai space.`
			`	Little blood reached the wall, but it surrounded one system. Perhaps this is a threat from some malevolent deity warning you of a terrible fate that will befall you there. You'll never sleep well again until you investigate.`
			`	Whatever fate may have in store for you, it can't be worse than a lifetime of insomnia.`

Apparently there's something they want you to assist with to get it over the line. They'll be waiting for you on Mountaintop when you're ready.`
