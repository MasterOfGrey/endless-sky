			`	He asks a few questions for clarity and when you're done he requests if you'd kindly wait for a moment while he makes a call. It is a lengthy wait, and at one point an aide comes in and offers you refreshments while deliberations continue elsewhere. Much to your surprise the fruity beverage is actually quite light and not too sweet, reminding you briefly that this is actually the world where your major foods originally evolved.`
			`	Eventually Mr Yang returns, "So sorry for that, I hope you were looked after suitably while you waited."`
			`	Once you nod your assent he continues, "Well, obviously the Republic knows about the Hai, but for the moment our official line is that the government does not trade in rumours. However, clearly an appropriate response is needed. I have been informed that Republic Intelligence has gone through official channels to brief the Free Worlds Council just yesterday. They have demanded that they have a trained diplomatic representative along for any decisions. This is already standard practice for the Syndicate. If you are willing, I will come with you, and we shall meet two individuals known as Katya and Alastair on Deep and Foundry respectively. I believe you already know them?"`

			`Landing on Foundry you are communicated to on a private encrypted channel and directed to a private hangar where you are greeted personally by CEO Alastair Korban.`
			`	He smiles warmly, "Apologies Captain <Last>, do excuse the cloak and dagger, but in the current media climate you and I are both too well known to be seen meeting without causing the rumour mill to grind out a new story."`
			`	"Now, allow me to introduce you to my protege Terry Adrianopolous, he will be accompanying you as the Syndicate representative."`
			`	The young woman goes from calculating to gregarious in the blink of an eye as your attention shifts to her. She's pleasant and approachable, and very articulate, but from your brief glimpse beforehand you have no doubt she's cut from the sort of cloth that makes her future CEO material. You resolve not to get on her bad side if at all possible.`
			`	"Oh by the way," says Alastair, pausing briefly as he turns to depart, "The navy and my security forces are working jointly to get some of our message relays up in the far north to link through Ultima Thule. The pirates are wont to destroy them whenever they find them but we should be able to rely on at least basic communication to get through if you need it. Rather than flying back and forth for literally every question. That's all."`

			`	You get down to business at the moment Sayeri inquires how your journey went.`
			choice
				`I don't recall there being nearly so many pirates.`
			`	Sayari frowns and exhales a long breath through her nose, "Yes. Well it seems that the rumours of us, and the information making its way through your media has attracted every opportunist this side of the Deep."`
			`	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`
			`	Alondo looks surprised, but Mr Yang and Ms Adrianopolous both merely nod sagely.`
			`	"Extra security forces are being called in, but we've been busier in Wah Ki than usual lately."`
			`	Mr Yang pulls out a datapad, "Well then I'm afraid I may have some bad news. May I?"`
			`	He gestures to a display and then takes control when indicated.`
			`	"One of the things I brought with me was Republic Intelligence's estimate of the effectiveness of various information containment measures."`
			`	A series of charts are thrown up on the screen. You're not an expert at reading this sort of data but highlighted percentages ranging from as low as 4% to only as high as 39% do not look promising. The final graphic is a map of stages of what is labelled as 'artifact penetration'.`
			`	"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is other than the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr Yang.`
			`	He checks the date, "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months or lose so much credibility as to compromise elctoral stability, the actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`"Would that be so bad?"`
			`	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret, if we act sooner we may control the manner of that secret's release."`
			`	Sayari looks at you, "We will have to come up with a plan, and quickly, but for the moment may I ask a favour of the war hero in the room? Please meet up with the security forces converging on Allhome, help them route the pirates back to the other side of the wormhole it will buy us some breathing space and some options."`
