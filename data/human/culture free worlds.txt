		`Farm world spaceports tend to be lonely affairs outside of harvesting season, but this one is bustling with festive energy. A statue of a bronze pig seems to be a permanent feature of the spaceport. Today it's surrounded by rows of colorful tents and throngs of the planet's natives. Most spaces that aren't taken by a silo, barn, or hangar of some sort have had a refreshment stand, game, or exhibition set up - the remaining few patches of ground are occupied by the feet of the planet's inhabitants. Live music fills the air, cheap beer flows like water, and fried food sizzles enticingly as it vacates vats of oil.`

		'Conversation with the locals eventually turns to the matter of what they're celebrating in the first place. As it turns out, the bronzed pig holds the clue. Today is the anniversary of the Great Pig War, a conflict which apparently raged between the Southern Defense Pact and the Syndicate unbeknowst to the larger galaxy. Toasts are raised in honor of nine heroic captains - and to the memory of a single martyrd swine.`
		`"Back in the fourties," a reveler drunkenly explains to you, "Half the farms'n'ranches'honesfolks about this planet were either about ready to leave or takin' out a second mortgage on their property. Bankers from richer worlds were always comin' about to reposess something or another." A passer-by spits on the ground in disgust at the mention - or perhaps he'd just succeeded in extricating some shredded pork from his teeth. "So some good honest boys decided they'd had enough of payin' tariffs and honoring exclusive shipping rights n' rot like that. They came 'round, bought up a whole herd of swine, and took off to feed some hungry folks in the Syndicate. Trouble is, back in those days the Syndicate had a stranglehold on shipping grain n' livestock. Either you signed up with this one shipping company and let them eat all your profits, or you let your harvest rot. Getting to market without being a member was... Somewhat frowned upon."`
		`By this point several others have gathered around the speaker. It would appear that recounting the tale of the Great Pig War to strangers is part of the tradition. "... Mnh. S'anyways. Some boys flew over to Maker with a hundred-"`
		`The speaker is interrupted by a shout of "It was a thousand!"`
		`"Quiet down! Ain't no way you could fit a thousand swine onto a hauler. Alright, so they've got two hundred pigs in their hold when they try to land on Maker. Syndicate Security shows up-" Boos echo throughout the crowd "- and tell these good, upright, honest smugglers that they're to match velocity n' prepare to be boarded. Now, they aren't about to bow down, so they make a break for the edges of the system but start taking hits. Quicksilvers are buzzin', Protectors lumberin' after them, and their shields go down. A particle cannon punches straight through the hull, and our good, kind, noble, brave boys n' girls stop their ship and start patchin' the whole, ready to surrender."`
		`The listeners go quiet. Tense anticipation fills the air. If not for the jolly music and overwhelming clamor of the crowd surrounding your little huddle, all would be hushed. "And that's when nine green-painted angels punched outta' hyperspace and began streaking towards our little drama. See, some of the local militia decided that justice was more important than jurisdiction, and they decided t'give the smugglers an unasked-for escort. These fine folk arrived late to the party, after the shooting had already started, but just in time to make it stop. Syndicate security's surrounded, and..." People huddled around the speaker are grinning eagerly. They've heard this story a hundred times - and evidently this is their favorite part. "The bastards stand down! Our smugglers didn't make any profit on accounta' having to turn back, and one pig got rendered into bacon by laserfire, but folks got emboldened enough to start disregardin' contracts and began organizing their own shipping. Refused to use those crooks that were extortin' us as being the only way to get goods off planet. And that's why every year, on the anniversary of the Great Pig War, we celebrate."`

		`You arrive at the spaceport just in time to witness a shuttle being towed off its landing pad by a tractor, a familiar blazon displayed upon the spacecraft's doors. Though it's made somewhat harder to recognize by the fact that somebody has spray-painted "REPOSESED" over the logo, it appears that this shuttle belongs to - or used to belong to - the very same galactic bank that cut you the loan for your first ship. If the crowd of jeering locals is anything to go by, it looks like popular opinion here doesn't favor the galaxy's financial instutitons. A group of militia members observe the blatant ship-theft, evidently unwilling to intercede. In fact, some of them are cheering on the hijackers.`
