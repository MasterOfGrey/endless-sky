			`As you walk past a number of ships and crew going about their work in the spaceport, a small gathering in front of a Shuttle catches your attention.  A young woman wearing a rather cheesy pilot uniform is in the midst of a little group of people all celebrating together.  As you pass by them, a man standing on the top of a ladder breaks a bottle of Champagne on the (clearly not new) ship's hull.  A loud cheer erupts from the group, earning an embarrassed blush from the young woman.`

			`	You hurry past the group as they quiet down.  Taking advantage of the momentary lull, you shout "Good luck!  You've got this!" towards them.  They let out another cheer in response, with the exception of the young woman who buries her face in her hands.`

			`	You approach the group as they quiet down, noticing hint of anxiety in the air.`
			`	"Nothing quite like buying your very first starship," you say over their chatter.  The celebration goes quiet as they turn to see who interrupted their little party.`
			`	"It's certainly been an...experience."  The young woman replies once you are in comfortable talking distance.`

				`	(Make a bad joke.)`
			`	"So, who's the lucky pilot?"  You ask, gesturing to the Shuttle.`
			`	"Uhh...that would be me."  The woman says, glancing around awkwardly.`

					goto getout

			`	"Well, good luck!" You say with a wave as you hurry away.  You barely hear the quiet 'thank you' over the burning in your ears.`

			`	"Right now," she says with a sigh, "the only plan I have is to get rid of the massive debt that I'm in because of it."
					goto advice

			`	"The mortgage isn't so bad as long as you're willing to work hard," you say with a smile, "and there is no shortage of people in need of a ship and a good pilot.`
			`	"I knew you could make a decent living with one, but is it really that easy?"  She asks.`
			`	"The work isn't easy, but finding a job is the least of your worries.  I'm sure that you'll have this ship paid off in no time."
			`	You stay around and talk with the aspiring pilot for a few minutes, giving her tips and advice before stating that you have work to do.  As you turn to leave, an older man places his hand on your arm, stopping you.`
			`	"Before you go," the man says, "we weren't very sure about this whole 'pilot' thing at first, but it's good to hear that my little girl has made the right decision.  Thank you for that."`
			`	"It's the least I could do." You say before walking away.`
