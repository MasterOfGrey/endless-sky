			`You are relaxing at the spaceport while your ship refuels after conducting a spot of business when a breaking news broadcast comes on; not urgent enough to actually interrupt scheduled content, but urgent enough to fill the first ad break.`
			`	The severe looking anchorwoman bores down the camera with an expression that demands attention.`
			`	"An ex-crewman employed by an itinerant trader has come forward to media in the Free Worlds about hostile aliens just beyond our borders! He claims to have brought video proof of an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war. Stay tuned for our full segment at 6."`
			`	You raise your eyebrows with surprise.`
			`	That such news should come out so soon after the Pug smacks of a hoax. A quick glance at the clock shows you only have ten minutes to wait so you stick around for the full segment out of curiosity.`
			`	Right on schedule the news returns with the severe anchorwoman. It turns out that the crewman in question had been picked up by a minor media outlet on Tarazed. He had apparently travelled many weeks before deciding to seek the media in order to avoid being shut down by republic intelligence if he contacted media elsewhere. The man is fairly young, and very well presented, though he has a bit of the paranoid about him that is plain to see even through a screen.`
			`	A clip of alien space ships in combat with weapons quite unlike anything produced in human space is shown, you've seen things, but not this.`
			`	It is only after this that the anchorwoman reveals that, while this was initially treated as a hoax, one of their own reporters posed a timely question to a well-respected trader and caused quite the stir when he slipped up and confirmed the existance of the aliens known as 'Hai'.`
			`	This is, of course, ridiculous... but maybe it would be good to go investigate this for yourself. You listen in to collect the relevant details for future reference.`

			`	The only aliens you know of whose conflict is even remotely connected to humanity is that of the Hai, but the raids by the Unfettered scarcely qualify as an onoing conflict that threatens humanity.
