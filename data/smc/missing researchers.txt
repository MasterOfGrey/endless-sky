			`	Duniip turns off his hologram and addresses his family, "I found us a pilot! He's going to take us all the way home." This was followed by four cheering family members and one baby's gurgle.`
			`	The family was already packed to leave. Duniip explains they move regularly so they're not found. It takes them under two minutes to finish preparations and don their holoprojectors.`
			`	Your walk back to the ship is largely uneventful until some men with strange scanners detect the Yeertle family. One man throws a small grenade with a green light on top. You recognize it as a low-level EMP device. All five holograms turn off, along with all of the computers within 20 meters. Fortunately, your ship is outside that range.`

There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about.`

They tell me that, if we can prove the kidnappings are from a coordinated effort, they'll put significant resources into solving the problem.

About one in seven we rescued were researchers, an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly they're being targeted."`

This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`

My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. My father eventually escaped. He is serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will. Sadly, the laws are written that way.`

Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering surrender. We demand the return of our people and the immediate cease of the killing of slaves."`
			`	The Prime Minister is the first to respond, "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. The war left them stronger than ever with our navies distracted fighting one another."`
			`	The President continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	The Prime Minister says, "We have a counter-proposal. The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Allhome. Hai visiting human space will check in with us. Our intelligence agencies will track their movements and see to their safety as best we can; they'll be given contacts on every planet to go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk of Navy lives."`

			`You meet Teeneep outside her Centipede and you're surprised to see her with no bodyguards. Instead of her Hai Elder robes, she's wearing what looks like a fencing outfit. There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a bandanna with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic gold medal.`
			`	She pays you for the trip and says, "These blades are not ceremonial. Leave your gun behind or the Unfettered may think you're an assassin. I'll protect you."`
			`	You hand your gun to a nearby Unfettered, and hope Teeneep is as capable as she claims.`
			`	Now that you see her in this guise, you remember a fencing match advertisement. She looks exactly like the fencing champion a few years ago. Is Teeneep a champion fencer as well as a civil rights leader and Hai Elder? From appearances, she hasn't been in adulthood for long.

			`	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away with his hand, and you notice it's on a very personal part of her body.`
			`	In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and cuts the man's arm off at the shoulder. While he's writhing in agony, she cleans her sword on his head, and then re-sheathes it. Teeneep is coated in the man's blood. She walks towards the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`

			`	As you enter the room, a pair of Unfettered grab you and pin you to the wall. Teeneep looks back and smiles kindly. It seems she doesn't fear for your safety. The Unfettered have simply made it clear you're not part of this conversation.`
			label watch
			`	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Twenty thousand Hai have been kidnapped and enslaved by human pirates. They're concealed in a subterranean base that can only be reached with a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone. Dozens of human capital ships and thousands of human pirates guard the Hai. We haven't enough Jump Drives to rescue them.`
			`	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I ask you be so again. Free our people from slavery, and kill their human slavers."`
			`	The Hai leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you? A race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai." He turns and walks away.`
			`	Teeneep dives beneath the man's legs and jumps on a nearby table in front of him. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she did. She unsheathes both swords and says, "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	She jumps down and puts both swords at his throat. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're sure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	"There is no need," he smiles. "Even on our planets, I've never met a woman half as brave as you. You are a True Hai and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them."`
			`	She re-sheaths her swords, tilts her head back, and says, "Bring the hairless ape over here." Apparently she means you.`
			choice
				`	"I'm a human, not an ape."`

Then go to Prime and tell them to prepare to outfit fifteen Shield Beetles. Hai-home will give you specifications. When you have finished, land at Allhome and we will rejoin you."`
			`	The Unfettered leader tells his troops, "Bring the ape back to its ship." The last sight you see in the room is the two leaders smiling at each other without speaking.`

			`When you land, you, Teeneep, and the Unfettered Hai are greeted as heroes. After a few hours of parades and parties, General Choot'k comes to you and Teeneep to bid farewell.`
			`	He shakes your hand and says, "You're a fine warrior, Captain <last>. You are as much a True Hai as any human can be, and it was an honor to fight alongside you in battle.`
			`	Then he turns to Teeneep and tells her, "You're the future leader of all our people, Teeneep. Come back with me to Darkcloak. Join the True Hai and lead us to victory."`
			`	Teeneep smiles and says, "I have already joined the True Hai in spirit, but my fight is here. I fight for the hearts and minds of our Fettered brethren. One day they will know the True Hai as I do, and we will be one."`
			`	The two come close and look into each other's eyes for a moment before kissing. You're surprised at how complicated open-mouth kissing is when both participants have finger-length incisors.`
			choice
				`	(Give them some privacy.)`
			`	As you walk back towards the party, you notice a Carrier and a Dreadnought landing in the distance. You walk towards the landing site, and soon a high-speed Teeneep flies past you saying, "We'll be late! Hurry!"`
			`	After a few minutes of running, you reach a conference hall and see the Prime Minister of the Republic and the President of the Free Worlds sitting at the head of a long table patiently awaiting Teeneep.`
			`	The three sign a treaty granting safe passage to all Hai in human space, so long as they register with customs on Allhome before entering. Extensive surveillance fleets are posted on both sides of the wormhole to detect any kidnappings or other illegal travel. Now the only way for illicit transfers to happen is if a government employee is involved, but all three countries agreed to watch for that behavior and punish it severely.`
			`	After another few parties, the celebrations end. The leaders of all three governments thank you for your help with sincere words, and <payment>.`
