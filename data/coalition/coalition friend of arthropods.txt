			`An event triggers when you're in Kimek space somewhere announcing a crisis on a Kimek world (Third Umber?) that does not have a well-developed biosphere. The Kimek have been setting up an isolated valley on this world to act as a grubbing ground, because at present the entire population has had to migrate there. No Kimek are born on this world.`
			`	The first generation of Kimek grubs have nearly matured, but a major storm has caused huge damage to the delicate ecology of the nascent grubbing ground. As a result, jobs will appear on every Kimek world to take emergency supplies of plants, bugs, animals, and biodegradables, to be dumped into the valley.`
